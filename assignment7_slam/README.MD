<h1>Assignmnet 7: SLAM</h1>

This Readme file contains information about this package and the demo videos for relevant tasks.

<h2>OUTCOMES</h2>

1.  SLAM on the real turtlebot
2.  Comparision between two different LiDARs for building the map for SLAM in gazebo

<h2>CONTENTS</h2>

This package consists of scripts and launch files to achieve the following tasks:

- Launch file to bringup the turtlebot, launch the slam node and the teleop node
simulataneously.
- Map generated by using both `gmapping` and `karto` SLAM 
- Videos for `map generaation by using gmapping and karto`, `autonomous navigation` and `3Dlidar visualization in Gazebo`

<h3>SLAM and Navigation</h3>

This task concerned with the MAP generation using the 2D lidar in real environment using both the `gmapping` and `karto` SLAM techniques. Furthermore, the next task was to autonomously navigate the turtlebot according to the map generated by running the `gmapping SLAM` node.

<b>The following command can be used to run the launch file - </b>

`roslaunch assignment7_slam assignment7.launch`

<h3>Comparision between the two LiDARs</h3>

Here is the changes we had made to the urdf files to bring the Hokoyu3D LiDAR -

After replacing the 2D LiDAR on the turtlebot with a `Hokuyo 3D LiDAR`, the visualized output in rviz by placing the turtlebot in a gazebo environment was as below -
